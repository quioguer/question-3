# question-3

This python script simply prints out all of the public repositories available to my user. It is written in Python using the 
PyGithub library for Github's REST API v3. You will need to install
PyGithub in order to run my Python script. The download and installation instructions are <a href="https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub">here</a>.

I installed the PyGithub library using <code> python3 -m pip install PyGithub </code>, made an alias <code> alias python = python3 </code>, and ran using <code> python3 printrepos.py </code> in my terminal.

Then, download my printrepos.py script, and run it in your python shell or via command line. Make sure you are using Python version 3.0 or higher.
